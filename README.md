# daily-planner

This project consists of a daily planner 'app' used for times between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm. 


At the top of the daily planner you can see the current date along with the time of day.


The daily planner app allows you to save your notes for a given hour. This allows the user to return to the website and not lose saved data.


The color coded hours represent the change in time of day, whether it be in the past (red), present (grey), or future (green).
